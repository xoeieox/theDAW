# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# theDAW single-container release image.
#
# Stage "ui" builds the React frontend with Vite. Stage "runtime" installs the
# locked Python dependency set with uv, copies the backend plus the built UI,
# and serves everything from one uvicorn process on port 8600. The backend is
# single-worker BY DESIGN: generation jobs, model locks, and the JOBS registry
# live in process memory, so this image must never run with multiple workers
# or replicas.
#
# The linux x86_64 resolution in uv.lock pins torch 2.7.1+cu126 from the
# PyTorch cu126 index. Those wheels bundle the CUDA userspace libraries, so
# the base image needs no CUDA toolkit; GPU access only requires the NVIDIA
# driver plus nvidia-container-toolkit on the host (see docs/DOCKER.md).
