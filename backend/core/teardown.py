"""Best-effort teardown of every child process the backend may have spawned.

The Shutdown/Restart buttons exit via ``os._exit`` (atexit handlers hang on
uvicorn shutdown when invoked from a request thread), which used to orphan
every running sidecar: the stems python process, the Magenta engine, and the
underfit dashboard all stayed resident holding their ports. This module gives
both the lifespan shutdown and the admin exit paths one place that stops them
all, swallowing every failure — teardown must never block or break process
exit.
